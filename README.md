This directory contains scripts and related files for processing Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data.

The top level `.yaml` files define the databricks workflows. 

The three folders contain the bronze and silver layer processing scripts for inpatients (`apc`), outpatients (`opc`) and A&E (`aae`).
